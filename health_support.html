                    <span>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV harms the body’s immune system which is the body’s natural defense mechanism that protects our bodies from diseases and infections. You can live for years (5 to 10) without having symptoms or knowing you have HIV and can pass it on to others. After being infected with HIV for several years, your immune system is severely damaged and your infection progresses to AIDS.</span>
